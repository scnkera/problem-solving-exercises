Imagine working on software that processes text. A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Create a function named palindrome that determines if a string is a palindrome. This method should take in one string as a parameter. This method should return True if the string is a palindrome.

Examples
Original string as parameter	Is it a palindrome?
"Hello, world!"	No
"racecar"	Yes
"noon"	Yes
"mom"	Yes
"kayak"	Yes
When considering example inputs and outputs, you likely considered edge cases. Your solution is only required to handle the nominal cases. As times allows, consider how to handle the edge cases you identified.
