Imagine programming the logic for a grocery store's online shopping system. In our scenario, a user has a cart of items, and each item has a cost.

Create a function named calculate_total that is responsible for summing the cost of the items in a user's cart.

This function should take in a list of strings named cart as a parameter.
This function should return the total cost of all items in the list cart.
Refer to this table for the price of each item carried by the store.
