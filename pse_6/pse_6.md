Imagine working on software that processes lists of numbers. Create a function named merge_lists that takes two sorted lists and merges them into a single sorted list. This function should take in two lists of whole numbers. The function should return a new sorted list which consists of the elements of the two arguments.

List 1	List 2	Output
[1, 2, 4, 5]	[6]	[1, 2, 4, 5, 6]
[-30, -10, 0, 15, 16]	[-20, -5, 5]	[-30, -20, -10, -5, 0, 5, 15, 16]
